# Lossless-Data-Compressor-and-Decompressor

The Lossless Data Compressor and Decompressor project aims to develop a software system that efficiently reduces the size of digital data while ensuring the complete preservation of its original information. This project will employ various lossless compression algorithms, such as Huffman coding to effectively eliminate redundancy and encode the data optimally during the compression phase. 
The decompression component will then seamlessly reverse this process, ensuring the exact replication of the original data. This project is significant for applications where data integrity is paramount, such as archiving, database management, and data transfer scenarios. By providing a versatile and reliable solution for lossless data compression and decompression, this project will contribute to more efficient data storage, reduced transfer times, and data optimization in a variety of fields.
